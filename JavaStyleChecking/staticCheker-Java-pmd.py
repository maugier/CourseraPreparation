NOTES: 
* The static checker shoud be running on the .java files after being compiled.
* The script doesn't work if the compilation stage is failed. 
* The static checker should be running in a separte directory to avoid 
  un wanted warnings from the testc cases.  
* The grade must be scaled later on according to the assignment 
* The script runs in the following way 
	/bin/run.sh pmd 	# Run the script 
	-d <file.java> 		# Supply a file to be checked 
	-f text			 	# Text format for the output file 
	-R <rule.xml> 		# Specify a certain rule 
	-version 1.7 		# PMD version 
	-language java 		# Specificy the langauge 
* We have the following checks to choose from "later"
		android.xml
		basic.xml
		braces.xml
		clone.xml
		codesize.xml
		comments.xml
		controversial.xml
		coupling.xml
		design.xml
